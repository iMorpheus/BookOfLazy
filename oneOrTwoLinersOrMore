- alias DST='open http://destinytracker.com/destiny/query/ps/EyeMorph ;
open http://guardian.gg/en/profile/2/EyeMorph/5' * Need to check my gaming stats.
- alias iT='open -a iTunes' * Self-explanatory: Open iTunes.
- alias AP='afplay -t 60' # Via the audio player - afplay() play the first 60 seconds of {audioTrack}. I don't have to leave the Terminal.app to identify what an audio file contains.
- alias SourceBash='source ~/.bash_profile'  * My scripts/alias are error-ridden missives to the computer. Lots of SOURCEing required. Can't be bothered typing in the file name every five minutes.
- alias EditBash='pico ~/.bash_profile'   * Early on, it was necessary for me to edit my profile page every thirty seconds.
- alias YTD='youtube-dl' * Passes url to youtube-dl for downloading. NOTE: Might add -f mp4 to avoid the occassional .webm download.
- alias bin='cd ~/bin/ ; clear ; ls -FC' * Ugh, what was the name of that script/directory?
